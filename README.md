# Solid Hacker News

Demo app based on [Vue Hackernews 2.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-hackernews-2.0). Uses Solid and Solid App Router, vite & SSR.

You can view it [here](https://hackernews.ryansolid.workers.dev/).

## Testing Locally:

First, you'll need to clone this repo, then cd into the `solid-hackernews` folder

Then, run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies

Lastly, run `pnpm dev` and the web-app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000/` in dev mode

Run `pnpm build && pnpm serve` and the web-app will be built in a `dist` folder and serve on localhost:3000

Happy Hacking!
